The first step is to configure the physical network. If two computers are going to get connected using a single Ethernet cable, it is necessary to verify that this cable is a crossover. The other option is to employ a switch between two computers that are then connected using two regular Ethernet cables.

After the physical network has been assembled, it is necessary to configure the network addresses and cards for all the computers in the network. It is important to remember that computers that are connected to each other should use the same subnetwork address. It is possible to verify the network configuration in a Linux computer by means of the ip addr command

Once the physical network and network cards have been configured, it is necessary to verify that the computers can communicate with each other. The simplest way to do this is by using the ping command:
