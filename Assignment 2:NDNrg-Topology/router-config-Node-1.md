Assume that three routers in the same network, but at three different sites (memphis.edu, arizona.edu, and colostate.edu), are connected to each other to construct the following topology:
***
 1. network and sample configuration
 
  Step 1. Ensuring nfd is running
  
  Step 2. Determining FaceUri
  
  Step 3: Creating configuration file
  
  
  Now, assume that /ndn/memphis.edu/router1 wants to advertise three name prefixes (/ndn/memphis/sports/basketball/grizzlies, /ndn/memphis/entertainment/blues, /ndn/news/memphis/politics/lutherking). The configuration file with the necessary configuration commands follows
  Step 4: Running NLSR on /ndn/memphis.edu/router1
