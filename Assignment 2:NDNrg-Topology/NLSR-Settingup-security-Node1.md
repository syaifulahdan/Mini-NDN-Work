To test the NLSR, the first step is

1. Configure keys and certificates that enforce secure communication between routers.
2. Verify that the computers on the test network are connected, that NFD is running and that the face between computers is configured.
3. Finally, the NLSR configuration file must be edited before running NLSR. The following subsections are provided as a guide for defining and configuring a simple computer network between two computers: router1 and router2.
