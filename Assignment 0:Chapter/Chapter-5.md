![[peek]](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-tools/blob/master/tools/peek): transmit a single Interest/Data packet between a consumer and a producer

![[chunks]](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-tools/blob/master/tools/chunks): segmented file transfer between a consumer and a producer

![[ping]](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-tools/blob/master/tools/ping): test reachability between two NDN nodes

![[dump]](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-tools/blob/master/tools/dump): capture and analyze live traffic on an NDN network

![[dissect]](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-tools/blob/master/tools/dissect): inspect the TLV structure of an NDN packet

![[dissect-wireshark]](https://github.com/named-data/ndn-tools/blob/master/tools/dissect-wireshark): Wireshark extension to inspect the TLV structure of NDN packets
