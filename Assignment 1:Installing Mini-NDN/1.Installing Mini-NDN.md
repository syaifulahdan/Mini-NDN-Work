Installing Mini-NDN

NOTE: Mini-NDN, while providing a high level of emulation of hosts, requires programs to be installed onto your computer. It will not work if they are not installed. If you do not want NDN software installed onto your computer, you can use a virtual machine, which can be quite simply set up with the provided vagrantfile.

<b>If you have all the dependencies (see sections below) installed simply clone this repository and run:</b>

<pre >

./install.sh -i

</pre>

<b>else if you donâ€™t have the dependencies, the following command will install them from source along with Mini-NDN:</b>

<pre>

./install.sh -a
</pre>

If you want to install the dependencies manually or from the Named Data PPA, follow the instructions below:

<b>Installing NDN</b>
Each node in Mini-NDN will run the official implementation of NDN installed on your system. The following dependencies are needed:
Mini-NDN uses NFD, NLSR, and ndn-tools.

To install NFD: https://named-data.net/doc/NFD/current/INSTALL.html 

To install NLSR: https://named-data.net/doc/NLSR/current/INSTALL.html

To install ndn-tools: https://github.com/named-data/ndn-tools

Note that all three of these can be installed from the Named Data PPA. Instructions for setting it up can be found in the NFD insallation instructions. Note that PPA and installs from source cannot be mixed.

Special Instructions for PPA Installs
If you are using a custom nfd.conf file in an experiment, you should place it in /usr/local/etc/ndn/ rather than /etc/ndn/. This is to avoid a bug from the default configuration file for the PPA, which is incompatiable with Mini-NDN.

<b>Installing Mininet</b>
Mini-NDN is based on Mininet. To install Mininet:

First, clone Mininet from github:
<pre>
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mininet/mininet.git
</pre>

After Mininet source is on your system, run the following command to install Mininet core dependencies and Open vSwitch:

<pre>
./util/install.sh -nv
</pre>
